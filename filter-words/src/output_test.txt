Especially common in online political slang.The opposite of cringe, some times the opposite of biased.The latter usage is the original use as coined by rapper Lil B, and the word originally took off on the meta-ironic website 4Chan with the latter meaning. For that reason the word is largely used meta-ironically (without context you can't tell if it's being used ironically or sincerely as it's used in both ways) and was popularized in online political slang of conservatives and the political right before being adopted into mainstream online political slang (likely through shitposting websites or subreddits such as r/politicalcompass memes that are similar to 4chan in their meta-irony and "edginess" but contain a wider variety of political beliefs) and eventually adopted into general online vernacular.When used in online political language it can mean "based in fact" or the opposite of biased due to the number of people who saw it being first used seriously by the online political right and came to the conclusion that is was related to the phrase "destroyed with facts and logic" in reference to right wing personality Ben Shapiro.

bogan:?-A fascinating beast. The majority of the species are hideously repugnant and unintelligent, and yet they manage to breed in ever-increasing numbers and populate an area known as the outer west. It is quite common to find five or six offspring in each family group, often with a different father for each new baby. Their habitat consists of a weatherboard or brick-veneer dwelling and is characterised by an early-model Holden or Ford in the driveway surrounded by a group of males discussing why the carby is stuffed and the results of last night's footy (a primitive gladiator-like spectator sport enjoyed by most bogans).The female of the species, while smaller in stature, is far more loud and aggressive than the male. While the males tend to be very friendly and congregate with other males, the females spend most of their time in supermarkets and shopping malls, using a shrill high-pitched call to discipline their children and contact other females. Males and females rarely interact socially except during breeding season, which is otherwise known as Friday night. During this time, females are allowed to enter the male-dominated area known as "the pub" and display their impressive coloured plumage to a prospective mate.Herein lies an intersting phenomenon. Males will often fight over a particularly attractive female and she will mate with only one male, while some less attractive females have been known to have several partners simultaneously. Ahhhh. The wonders of nature.

The choice to use that word was definitely not random. Ice T just happened to be on the show that night, and he likely fed the word to them beforehand and certainly helped fuel its popularity during the telecast ("That was seriously crunked up, right there."). But Ice never claimed to have come up with the word--he probably got it from Dirty South rappers, who had been using it for years as a euphemism for getting really crazy and fucked up on marijuana and alcohol (stoned and drunk. Chronic plus Drunk = Crunk). Or maybe crack and drunk. Or coke and drunk. Or maybe just being crazy and drunk. Whatever it is, it means getting really crazy and fucked up. And with Conan's introduction of the word to northern suburban audiences, Crunk came into its own as the recognized sound of the new generation of Dirty South Rap, prompting white college fratboys everywhere to wander around going "WHHHUT!! OKAAY!! YEEEAAHHH!!" like annoying dipshits. and it's all thanks to Lil Jon, and by Lil Jon I mean Dave Chappelle.

Delco is a blue collar kind of town. We're the ones who built the houses MontCo and Chester County. We're white collar wannabe's and don't really care how we do on our annual reviews. It's not a bad thing, it's just who we are.  Delco is something you can spot from across the bar while out of town. Speaking of bars, there's a 42:1 ratio when it comes to Bars to Library's. And, it's cool to be a 26 year old bar back...you're just waiting for your big break. Delco is in everyone, you just need to find it and to find it you need to live it. It's the way you walk, the way you look and the way you talk. The residences of Delco arent cocky, we're confident....confident because we know. When describing someone else from Delco, you say their name, state that you know them, say they're a good guy/girl, and then say their high school or the parish they're from. That's it. No need to disclose any additional information because that's all you need to know. Again, if you don't live here, you won't understand. (Not being cocky here either..) When telling other people that you're from Delco, they'll look you up and down and snarl and stare. But hey, we're used to it by now.  There's no bigger bar tour the Saturday before St. Patty's Day.

They'll pack any bar, any night of the week.  Think we're not smart? Delco's got a few colleges and universities sprawled out across out great land.  We should have our own flag. It would be a map of Delco on a Green and White flag. And it would say DELCO real big through the center. Nothing fancy because that's not who we are and once you see it you'll know the meaning behind it.  Delco can be your friend if you would like it to be, but that's up to you.  You can find Delco and a whole lot of it down the shore on the weekends between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Delco packs 20 people into a 3 bedroom house each weekend during these months.

furry:?-There is no one single definition of what a furry is. Even within the furry fandom, people cannot always agree on just what makes a person a furry or not. Some would argue that to be a furry, you must think and talk like one (i.e. use furry specific words and phrases). Even if you go to conventions, wear a fursuit, draw the art, writes the stories etc but don't talk using furry lingo, you're not a furry. Basically, someone that may walk the walk but doesnt talk the talk. Others would argue that even liking anthropomorphic creatures makes you a furry. You may have no idea the furry fandom exists or have ever heard of a furry convention, let alone any of the websites; simply liking 'anthro' critters makes you a furry. The way I see it, if or if you dont consider yourself a furry is a matter of personal opinion. As with any hobby, most furries are normal people just like anyone you'll meet at work/school or going to/from work/school or anywhere. Then there is the small percent that are hard core fans and have taken what for most is a hobby and perverted it (sometimes in an all to literal sense).  As is with so many other things in life, the few that take it too far tend to be the loudest. The silent majority are often forced into silence by the loud majority for fear that people will label them as being in the same class as the minority that have perverted it. One unfortunate side effect of the internet and the relative anonymity that some sites grant their users is people are able to engage in activities (even if only on a virtual level) that they would never even consider doing in real life. An example of this is trolls of message boards that say things to people theyd never say to them in person. I think a lot of the stereotypes associated with furries are because of this.

horus:?-OK you imbeciles... n.  Horus is one of the most ancient deities of the Ancient Egyptian religion, who appears in his earliest form in late Predynastic Egypt. Represented as a falcon, his name is believed to mean 'the high' or 'the far off' and his earliest connections are to the sky and kingship, derived from being the son of Hathor or Nut, as a sun god. Because the cult of Horus survived for the whole of the Ancient Egyptian civilization that extended for thousands of years, he gained many forms and associations. Horus was usually represented as a man with a falcon's head. One important association is the Eye of Horus which was an Egyptian symbol of power (first identified with Wadjet and seen on images of his mother, Hathor, as she was emerging from the reeds) and of the offerings made to the god Osiris and by extension, to all of the dead. In one myth cycle Horus' left eye is injured during his struggle with his uncle Set, who had murdered Osiris in an attempt to seize the Egyptian throne. The Eye of Horus, its injury, and subsequent restoration became an important symbol for the unified land of Egypt and in the funerary rites of the renewal after death.

indie:?-The term: Short for independent rock. In terms of music it would be independent of major labels/mainstream stuff. History: grew out from 60s garage, 70s punk, and 80s post punk it started in the mid 80s as alternative/college radio music. Once nirvana hit big the alternative genre split: the popular side was just alternative(Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, No Doubt, etc.) and the other half that wasn't mainstream(by choice or not) became indie rock(Pavement, Sebadoh, Built To Spill, etc). Some bands have signed to major labels but are still considered indie(Modest Mouse, etc.). Go figure. Sound: In the begining indie sounded like alternative(because it was) but it grew more experimental and weird. In Britain indie has more of a typical sound like Radiohead, Muse, etc. rather than a definition based on 'the scene.' The scene: if you really think all indie kids do is try to be cooler than other people then... well.. you're mostly right. The main point is, don't take the scene and the whole hipster attitude seriously. No one does. And if you do, well, then I'm cooler than you.

irony:?-One of the most misused words in the entire English language. There are several types of irony. Socratic irony - When someone pretends to be naive about a certain subject, and uses his questions about it to point out a flaw in the established belief.  This is often used on the TV show South Park, where the children often ask questions about a situation until the folly in a parent's decision becomes clear. Sarcasm - Understatement, mocking overstatement, or heavy-handed irony (stating the flat opposite of the truth) where both parties are aware of the difference between what's said and what's actually happening. Situational Irony - The irony that most people think of.  A difference between what you expect to happen (in a story, for example) and what actually happens.  Rain on your wedding day would be a sort-of example, because a wedding day is generally expected to be a perfect, happy day.  The good advice you didn't take, however, would NOT be irony, because that has nothing to do with what is expected and what isn't expected.  A traffic jam when you're already late wouldn't be irony either; there's no automatic expectation that traffic will be fine, just because you happen to be late. Irony of Fate - The concept that the Gods, Fates, etc. are toying with humans for amusement by using irony.  Beethoven's loss of hearing is a famous example; one would expect a composer to be able to hear his compositions, but fate denied him that ability. Tragic (Dramatic) Irony - When the audience knows something that some of the characters don't know in a play/movie/novel/whatever. For example, when the horror flick psycho is in the house and the homeowner just goes in without suspecting anything.

jappy:?-A quintessential Jewish American Princess: naggy, ultra-high maintenance, whiny, always wanting their way, extremely moody, spoiled rotten, and looking for a "nice," wealthy "Jewish boy" (as Jewish mothers like to call Jewish men in their 20s).  They often take on much of the overbearing traits of their mothers, who nag and are over-critical of everything they do, destroying the girls self-esteem starting at a young age.  When they do start dating guys, they often tend to be EXTREMELY emotionally needy as their lack of self esteem becomes obvious and they have to let their guard down. These girls do experiment with goy (Hebrew for "non-Jewish") males, but only white ones and definitely not shvartzas (Yiddish derogatory word for blacks).  They seem to have no preference for WASPs or Catholics - just who is going to be the most successful in case they do screw up and fall in love b/c he must at least be able to support her expensive tastes. Why?  B/c non-Jewish white guys tend to be much better looking than their Jewish male counterparts (caution: gross generalization, but the truth - just ask any JAP of their goy good-looking male dilemma) and since they always get what they want financially from their parents, they must get what they want in terms of men too.  Plus, those Non-Jewish men aren't as big of push-overs as Jewish guys so they do represent a challenge since they won't put her with her crap - secretly, like all women but to a greater extent, the JAP loves to be treated poorly with intermittent good treatment b/c it shows that he does not need her. Basically, the JAP is just the extreme example of all women's insecurities: emotionally needy, low self esteem and wants everything their way.  JAP characteristics are carrying over to non-Jewish rich girls now too, mainly the daughters of the nouveau riche.

jrotc:?-Acronym for Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, which has the purpose of "motivating young people to become better citizens". It is arguably one of the best programs offered in high school. It is taught by retired army instructors (both enlisted and commissioned). Students who are enrolled in the program are called cadets. The typical weekly schedule for a JROTC program is: Drill and ceremony once a week, physical training once a week, uniform inspection once a week, and academics twice a week. Aside from the minimum standard of attending class, there are also optional teams available for the more involved and dedicated cadets to be a part of which include drill team, raider team, rifle team, color guard, honor guard, etc. JROTC units also attend annual camping trips in the fall, spring, and summer. The class is harder to fail then it is to pass with an A since the book work is relatively easy and limited.JROTC is horribly portrayed as a war machine used to brain wash high school students by anti-war protesters, claiming that it promotes violence, sexism, racism, etc. they also make false claims that the majority of JROTC cadets enlist in the armed forces upon graduation from high school when, in fact, the lot of them go on to further education and become leaders in the civilian and/or military field.In my opinion, the only downside to the program is the fact that ANYONE can join it, therefore allowing fuck offs who are only in it to get an "easy A" to make the program look retarded.

linux:?-If Operating Systems Ran The Airlines...  UNIX Airways  Everyone brings one piece of the plane along when they come to the airport. They all go out on the runway and put the plane together piece by piece, arguing non-stop about what kind of plane they are supposed to be building. Air DOS  Everybody pushes the airplane until it glides, then they jump on and let the plane coast until it hits the ground again. Then they push again, jump on again, and so on...  Mac Airlines  All the stewards, captains, baggage handlers, and ticket agents look and act exactly the same. Every time you ask questions about details, you are gently but firmly told that you don't need to know, don't want to know, and everything will be done for you without your ever having to know, so just shut up. Windows Air  The terminal is pretty and colourful, with friendly stewards, easy baggage check and boarding, and a smooth take-off. After about 10 minutes in the air, the plane explodes with no warning whatsoever.  Windows NT Air  Just like Windows Air, but costs more, uses much bigger planes, and takes out all the other aircraft within a 40-mile radius when it explodes. Windows XP Air  You turn up at the airport,which is under contract to only allow XP Air planes. All the aircraft are identical, brightly coloured and three times as big as they need to be. The signs are huge and all point the same way. Whichever way you go, someone pops up dressed in a cloak and pointed hat insisting you follow him. Your luggage and clothes are taken off you and replaced with an XP Air suit and suitcase identical to everyone around you as this is included in the exorbitant ticket cost. The aircraft will not take off until you have signed a contract. The inflight entertainment promised turns out to be the same Mickey Mouse cartoon repeated over and over again. You have to phone your travel agent before you can have a meal or drink. You are searched regularly throughout the flight. If you go to the toilet twice or more you get charged for a new ticket. No matter what destination you booked you will always end up crash landing at Whistler in Canada. Linux Air  Disgruntled employees of all the other OS airlines decide to start their own airline. They build the planes, ticket counters, and pave the runways themselves. They charge a small fee to cover the cost of printing the ticket, but you can also download and print the ticket yourself. When you board the plane, you are given a seat, four bolts, a wrench and a copy of the seat-HOWTO.html. Once settled, the fully adjustable seat is very comfortable, the plane leaves and arrives on time without a single problem, the in-flight meal is wonderful. You try to tell customers of the other airlines about the great trip, but all they can say is, "You had to do what with the seat?"

mafia:?-Ok, I recommended many definitions for deletion. It seems everybody has thier personal version of mafia's history. I am Sicilian and the study of the Mafias (we prefer plural vs one single mafia) is one of my interests, as a Sicilian and as a student. Also... I'm no member of any "family" you may think of. The word itself has rather obscure origins, and its history and meaning is totally unrelated with modern concept of mafia. Modern Mafias have so many different aspects I couldn't say if one is wronger than others. Nowadays the term "Mafia" can be rightly (and sadly) related to almost every socio-political aspect of our lives. We could say the word itself has gained a more general and complex meaning since its migration from Sicily to USA. As regards the word itself: its origin can be traced back in the centuries. Sure it had something to do with the many invasions Sicily was exposed to. During the ages, Sicily has been invaded by pretty much ALL of the peoples in the Mediterranean Area: Greeks, Romans, Normands (~French), Arabs, Spanish, Italians nowadays. This gave the island's culture an inmense richness, but as a side effect created among Sicilians some sort of silent "brotherhood" against anyone coming from the outside world. This "brotherhood", meaning protection of the masses from the invasors, lately degenerated into an oppression of the masses. The term mafia, originally indicating (not meaning) a group of people "respected" for being charismatic  members of that brotherhood, slightly but inesorably turned into a synonym for organized crime. My personal idea is that the two different meanings still coexist in Sicilian culture, often originating a confusig and ambiguous mix. As regards the "international" meaning... well I guess everybody has a very distorted prespective, maybe the best definition is "Those loud mouth Italian criminals talking with gestures like in the class A movie The Godfather"!

malay:?-A race that resides mainly in Malaysia but can be found in Singapore, Brunei and other countries. Makes up the majority of the population in Malaysia. Interestingly enough although they claim to be natives of the country, they do not actually originate from Malaysia. Even so they are given many privileges, including housing, education and business contracts over the other races. They also seem to perform poorly acedemically and in a general consensus taken in 1998 from all high schools, they was a worrying gap between their grades as compared to the other races. However, they remain an integral part of the community as they make up the majority of the manual labour work force.

mambo:?-Among the many dance forms that became popular among Cubans and their tourist visitors between World War II and the Cuban Revolution, the Mambo was arguably the peppiest. During the era of Latin big bands in the 1940s and 50s, Mambo artists such as Perez Prado and Machito and his Afro-Cubans were similar to and influenced by American Swing orchestras with their swollen brass sections. In fact, Mambo is named after the instrumental break when horn players would trade licks and push the dancers into a frenzy. Like the Cuban cha-cha-cha, it became popular in New York City with non-Cubans and was quickly adopted into the repertoire of the popular big bands.

manga:?-Contrary to what most people in the West think, manga (both the singular and plural form are the same) have NOTHING to do with pronorgraphy. Some manga are pornographic, but that's just a small percentage of manga. Manga, in Japanese, means "flowing words" or "Undisciplined words". It is an ancient art that has been used for centuries as a form of entertainment. It's basicallt Japanese comic books, which can be easily translated to English. However, just saying manga are comics from Japan is wrong. First of all, in the US and in Europe, most comics are addressed to young children between the ages of 9 and 13. That is not the case of manga. There are 6-7 major types of manga, each having its own audience. Kodomo manga is for children. Shonen manga is for boys ages 12-18 , Shoujo manga is for gilrs age 12-18. Josei manga is for adult ladies above the age of 20, mainly working women. Seinen manga is for young men between the ages of 18 and 30, and Hentai manga is pornographic, adult manga. As you can see, saying "comics from Japan" is wrong. Another difference between manga and Western comics is that each comics volume has its own plot, while manga volumes all follow the same plot. The artwork is VERY different. Manga has its own particular artwork, especially when it comes to human faces, particularly the eyes, chin, nose, mouth, forehead... Manga is also read from RIGHT to LEFT. (Yes, even the English ones). In Japan, 40% of all book & magazine sales are manga. That's a huge number, considering the Japanese read A LOT. In 1998, about 3 billion manga volumes were printed in Japan, I'm sure that number is higher now. Many manga have been translated to English and are sold everywhere.

You can even call a man pizda (cunt); but you never could say "she's a mudak". Neither you can form the feminine gender of the noun, like for the similar word durak (fool) - dura (feminine for durak). No way. So it's always a "dumb prick" but never a "dumb cunt".Of course, "mudak" is an offensive word, but not as offensive as a pidar (faggot) or even a kozel (goat).

Some people even call themselves mudaks with some degree of vanity; e.g. the most renowned blogger of the Russian Web is pretty comfortable with a nickname Tupoi Mudak (a kind of redundancy here, i.e. the dumbest dumb jerk).

Living in middle-class western and northern suburbs they are depicted by their cars..  Usually canary yellow VL turbos (often built by the Rajabs), VN 5 litre's, VQ Statesmans or the R33 Skyline.. Baseball caps are constantly worn alongside hair product, but to make sure they dont wreck their hair the caps sit on top of their hair (and away from the fringe).  Bum-bags are a must to hold all your mobile phones (one for the bros, and one for the hoes), and also some change to spend at maccas.   They walk like they're trying to immitate a scarecrow, or like they're holding a bucket of water in each hand (with a subtle swaying motion)  This is often a result of going to the gym once or twice and thinking your lats are so huge you cant put your arms straight down your side. As soon as there's any drizzle outside muzzas call all their bros and go do some demos in your cars.. ripping it up in the wet is considered "free demos" because it doesnt bald your tires as much. Muzzas are often highschool dropouts currently doing apprentiships, with every cent they earn going towards their cars (mostly on tires and petrol), and they end up wondering why all their bros who went to uni end up driving mercs and picking up chicks while they stick to their teeny bopper marias (which are the 13-16yr old female equivalent of a muzza) who are the only chicks who go for these guys.   Common hangouts are Bell St maccas, or any other Hungry Jacks 24hour store carpark, but the most common place (which is guarenteed to give you some pure muzzas) has got to be Chapel Street on Friday and Saturday nights.  Doing constant and repetitious laps of this popular shopping strip is a must, and ensures many hours of sitting in traffic at 3am on a Saturday morning.

Comments about the smog and that socalers steal their water will always come us.   This comes to a surprise to most socalers because growing up in places like: LA, OC, San Diego, Long Beach, and even the the meth-infested Riverside, socalers do not care about nocalers.  Nocal never cross the mind of socalers unless they visit there or they meet a travelling nocaler.  For some reason nocalers are obsessed with hating socal even though they love to visit Disneyland.  It can be compared to the New Englanders hating New Yorkers.   The capital of nocal is San Francisco.  Referred as "the city" by nocalers even though it is only 7 mi X 7 mi large (a fraction of the size of the San Fernando Valley section of LA).  All the cool things in nocal are relegated to "the city" because nocalers love to live bland lives.  Inland nocal is Sacramento and places like Redding, Modesto, and Lodi, all full of white trash and rednecks.  The Bay Area sans SF is chalk full of lilly-white liberals who speak of equal rights but are too afraid to go to black or Latino neighborhoods.  This is another underlying reason for their hate for socal. All the Bay Area suburbs are geographically segregated and suburbs like Walnut Creek, Napa, and Pleasanton stay lilly white while Los Angeles area suburbs are all intermingled.  Bay Area residents do not like to mention this and like to keep up their liberal facade.

otaku:?-The term "otaku" seems to have been introduced to anime fans in the US and other countries via Studio Gainax's "Otaku no Video 1985," a self-parody film.Otaku, meaning probably "venerable house," refers to someone who has a devotion to a subject or hobby (not necessarily anime) to the point of not leaving home.  For instance, an otaku fan of a particular movie star could quite possibly know all of the films s/he has been in, their birth date, time of birth, shoe size, favorite toothpaste, etc.  Generally speaking, calling someone an otaku in Japan is an insult, implying that their social skills have atrophied or never even developed, due to their manic involvement in their chosen fandom. In America, the term is used to denote a zealous fan, usually of anime and/or manga.  Due to its introduction to most people's vocabulary through its tongue-in-cheek use in Gainax's film, "otaku" tends to have a much less dire definition overseas. When dealing with Japanese people, however, it may be best to keep in mind the modern Japanese image of an otaku -- Someone who only leaves their home to eat or shop, if at all, with an overwhelming and unhealthy obsession about something.  It can as easily refer to a stalker or sociopath as it can to a harmless anime buff. Best to avoid the word altogether if one is not sure of the context in which it will be received.

A Lid:  Generally mistaken to be exactly one ounce of        marijuana, a lid is actually just a large bag or        container of marijuana similar or comparable in        amount to an ounce. Well, now you should pretty much know the terms used to describe verious amounts of marijuana.  Standard prices should start with $15-20/gram, $50-60/8th, $100-115/quad, 300-360/ounce, and an absolutely sick amount of money that nobody should ever spend for a kilo.  You want a kilo, you grow a kilo.  You grow a kilo, you become my friend. The End.

A roach, in England, is a small piece of cardboard, often torn from the pack of rolling papers, which is rolled and placed into the mouthpiece of the joint. This makes it easier to hold and also makes it possible to smoke the entire joint without the aid of a roach clip. 2. In America, people tend not to smoke joints using tobacco, and what is called a roach in England is termed a filter in America. The roach is the end of the joint which cannot be smoked without a roach clip, because the smoker's fingers would be burnt. The roach contains the most resin and is stronger than the rest of the joint because THC smoke has passed through and settled on it with each inhalation. A roach is often saved and smoked in a joint made from other roaches, which is much stronger than a normal joint.

Thus, SNAFU proved insufficient to describe the situation where a narcissistic sociopath gathered racist nihilists, Russian agents & toadies as his closest advisors, unleashed rampant neopotism in the White House, installed incompetents like Betsy deVos, Dr Ben Carson & Gov Ricky Perry to head agencies they're intent on destroying & unleashed blatant self-dealers like Sec* Tom Price to gut the Dept of HHS & 'ObamaCare'.Oxford English Dictionary lexicographers said Drumpf simply overwhelmed & broke the abbreviation SNAFU. "The magnitude of the unrelenting shitstorm generated by the Bull Shitter-in-Chief & abetted by his Cavalcade of Toadies created the need for an new abbreviation to capture a state that transcends SNAFU & thus SNATU spontaneously emerged into the lexicon."Unlike with so many of the fake-facts that he & his minions have spewed upon the civic & political landscape, his supplanting SNAFU with SNATU represents a genuine accomplishment he can to point to as he closes his bigly sad initial 100 days as Preznit of the United States.

Speed also goes by the street names Ice, Crystal meth and Shabu 2 The drug works using Dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is used in all matters of the brain from learning to attentiveness. However, the most prominent usage of dopamine is to incite the brains reward system. Dopamine is released in the brain naturally when people eat, drink and have sex. 1 Dopamine is released into the synaptic space in between the pre and postsynaptic neurons. Here is where speed comes in. Speeds goal (Speed doesnt really have a goal it merely exists, but this is the reason people use it) is to trigger a buildup of Dopamine. Speed first enters the Terminal Button in one of several ways. Speed is very similar on a molecular level to Dopamine so Speed can enter the Dopamine transporter or speed can diffuse into the neuron. The amphetamine then expels the dopamine out into the synaptic space. It does this through a process that forces the Dopamine transporters to go in reverse. Under natural circumstances Dopamine is brought back into the terminal button through the Dopamine reuptake pumps. These pumps do not work as well when speed is present in the brain and the Dopamine remains longer as a result. Speed also inhibits monoamine oxydase A (MAO-A).1 Speed also forces glutamate to come into the synaptic space. The result of this is dopamine will flow more easily. 	The effects people notice with amphetamines make it clear why the drug has earned the name speed. Speed makes everything go faster. When on the drug, which can be taken in forms of powder, pills and injections, your heart rate blood pressure and movements all increase in speed. 2 It also makes sleep difficult.  The size of the users pupils increase and weight loss becomes easier. While the user is high off the drug he or she can expect to feel good, be more willing to take risks and be excited.2 Speeds long-term effects are for the most part similar to many other drugs. Speed causes depression, personal problems, anger and violence. Speed is also addicting. There is one more side effect that is more unique to the drug. This side effect is coined psychosis. Psychosis is a serious psychological problem. People that suffer from it hear voices in their head, become delusional and paranoid. Psychosis victims are known to see things that arent there and often feel that ordinary objects and people want to hurt them.4. In Requiem for a Dream a movie about the downward spiral instigated by drugs, An elder widow is prescribed diet pills, which are speed. When she becomes addicted she believes her refrigerator is trying to kill her.3 Amphetamines although possibly more enjoyable then other drugs also negatively affect you sooner. 3 Fevers, heart attacks and death are all possible results of the use of speed.2
spice:?-Spice, also known as "synthetic marijuana", "legal/fake weed", "K2" etc., is a drug created by spraying herbs with synthetic chemicals that, when consumed, allegedly mimic the effects of cannabis. It's effects are much stronger than those of natural marijuana, and although not thoroughly researched, are known to be dangerous.Seriously, there is NO reason for this stuff to be legal. Along with bath salts, this is probably the second most dangerous shit you can put into your body without getting into law trouble. It feels like you have been poisoned by someone, extreme shivering and paranoia, vomiting, increased heart rate... You could say it has weed's effects, minus the fun.This stuff is a RESEARCH CHEMICAL. While you're buying it, you should probably ask yourself why are you buying fake weed in the first place, because if you're gonna go this far just to get "high", you shouldn't even be getting high, you're addicted.You do not know with what this stuff is sprayed with, and it can have REALLY traumatic effects on a first-timer or even an experienced marijuana user. I've had people tell me that spice totally ruined weed for them later on.Spice is poison. DO NOT smoke this stuff. Seriously, awareness campaigns should be started just so people know what this shit is. Yes, some states in the US have criminalized it, but it is still 100% legal in most of Europe. You've been warned.source: Personal experience + frient of mine collapsed after one hit.

supra:?-The word S U P R A didn't always enjoy the respect it has today. The S U P R A's beginnings were humble. Back in the days of roller rinks and AC/DC 8 track cassettes (enjoy your iPod, youngsters) there was the Celica. Unlike the modern Celica, the 1970s era model was a little car, scoffed at by Firebird-driving Burt Reynolds fans. Then came the 80s (okay, 79), and a new kind of Celica...the Celica S U P R A! But it wasn't Super. Its suspension was better suited for back seat lovin' than high speed racing and everyone knew it. It made do with a single overhead cam CRESSIDA engine. But hey, it was better than the Celica, and a step in the right direction, with disc brakes all around.  In 1981 another Celica S U P R A was released. It was DOHC this time around, and had independent rear suspension, but was still basically a Celica.  By 1986 the first true S U P R A was born. No longer just a sporty Celica, this S U P R A was designed to stand on its own. Toyota went all out with its new Flagship. It sported a new engine design (the 7M-GTE) built around a 3 liter inline 6 cylinder engine andget thisa TURBO and INTERCOOLER!! This packed 230 bhp @ 5600 rpm. Impressive stuff in 86. Sadly, Toyota released the car in America WITHOUT the turbo and intercooler, which dropped output to 200 bhp. And the car wasn't light at over 3400 lbs. Critics panned the styling as generic and overly conservative (looking eerily like a Porsche 944 knockoff). But again, it made strides of progress with reworked suspension geometry, fatty (for the day) tires, improved brakes, and Toyota's TEMS Electronic Modulated Suspension for on-the-fly selectable shock absorber rates. Just press Sport and go. But was it a true sports car? Not really. The third generation S U P R A was more of a Grand Tourer.    In 87 the 3rd Gen Turbo and intercooler setup finally came stateside in the S U P R A Turbo and caught the attention of the mullet crowd. Still, the S U P R A was not quite an icon. Perhaps it was the extra gristle, which took the car's weight up to a portly 3600 pounds (if you got the sport roof). Its 6.8 psi of boost was commendable, but not enough to lay a solid claim to the throne held by domestic muscle, or exotic style.   But all that would change in 1993 with the 4th generation S U P R A...the JZA80. This is the S U P R A that has become legendary. THIS is the S U P R A you will use in SRS to lay waste to the competition.    Unlike any previous S U P R A, this one was so completely restyled that it was as if it just fell out of the sky. It had TEN insectoid looking lights forward of the front wheel well! And that Spoiler! WHOA! It was huge, functional, and didn't block your scanning for Police in the rear view. Gone were the harsh wedge-like angles of the 80s, replaced by the muscular curves that would come to symbolize 1990s automotive design. Back seats and cargo space were an afterthought. The JZA80 was new from the ground up, and built with the goal of producing incredible power and saving weight in every conceivable way.  And save weight it did. As if obsessed, the engineers trimmed in ways only they could have conceived of. When the assembly line rolled in Motomachi, Japan, they started with conventional wisdom to save weight. They built the hood, roof and bumper supports out of aluminum. Makes sense. They used cast aluminum 17 inch rims. Sounds good. But get this, further weight savings came via a PLASTIC fuel tank and hollow anti-roll bars.  That's dedication. Then they just lost their damned minds. They used hollow head BOLTS wherever structurally feasible and (I'm not making this up) even went so far as to create hollow fiber CARPET in an effort to tip the scales.    With weight minimized, they looked to power. Toyota's name for power is 2JZ-GTE. Simply put, the 2JZ is 3 liters of DOHC 24-valve, Inline Six, middle finger to anyone who doubted Toyota's ability to build a race ready engine. It is the ultimate weapon in Toyota's production arsenal and has seen tuned versions exceed 800 bhp! This block would be called upon to do double duty not only for Toyota's S U P R A line, but would almost single-handedly carry the Lexus brand as well. The Lexus SC300 and GS300 would come to use this mighty platform, and even the IS300 uses a detuned version of it.   That detuned version can also be found in the base model JDM S U P R A (SZ-R). In that configuration the 2JZ is naturally aspirated and can crank out 220 bhp at 5800 rpm. Not exactly pure power, but like I said...base model. Now in JDM S U P R As like the mighty RZ the 2JZ engine shows its potential. The RZ sees the glorious return of the turbo. It straps on sequential twin turbos and an intercooler, which catapult it into the 276 bhp (or 280 PS) range. The car is capable of much more, but Toyota willingly limited the power to 280 PS to maintain the gentleman's agreement that was in place among Japanese auto manufacturers at the time.   Fortunately for S U P R A fans, America doesn't count. In general, Japanese sports cars are released in America in a watered down form. Look at any J-Spec rocket, and compare it to the U.S. Spec. It'll make you sad. One of the only exceptions was when Toyota unleashed the S U P R A on America. Unshackled from the agreement in place in Japan, the U.S. S U P R A Turbo is a monster that even an RZ owner would fear.  Power jumps up from 276 bhp in the RZ to 320 bhp of whup-ass thanks to 11.6 psi of boost in the U.S. Turbo. It has torque enough to bench press a Celica without breaking a sweat, twisting 315 lb-ft @ 4000 rpm, and through some sort of mad scientist wizardry, 90 percent of that torque is available from 1300 to 4500 rpm. Mate this to a GETRAG six speed (short throw) and you've got serious neck SNAP potential.   This S U P R A can crush you into your seat for the 5 seconds it takes to hit 60, and can run a quarter mile in the mid 13s if you are brave enough to push the needle to the 6800 rpm redline. And while the S U P R A is electronically limited to 155 mph, the Speedometer's 180 mph max is telling. With limiter disabled, the car can hit 170, stock.   Left to mere mortals this much power would get most of us killed, but Toyota has provided some assistance for the ham fisted and lead footed. For a start the S U P R A has a Traction Control System which detects wheel spin, and in those hairy moments between Oh $#!T and Call a tow truck, applies rear brakes, retards engine ignition timing and controls a sub-throttle valve until the wheels regain grip. Then there's a Torsen (Torque-sensing) LSD at the rear, to keep the corners manageable. And the brakes are massive, nearing 13 inches in rotor diameter with 4 piston calipers up front and 2 piston in the rear. These are thankfully slotted up front, and functional brake scoops channel air to cool the rear brakes, as if they somehow  knew you'd need to stop from ridiculous velocities without pesky brake fade. Lateral G-sensing 4-channel ABS controls front and rear inside and outside brake assists independently so that even when stomping wildly into corners (as this car could prompt you to do) the brakes resist lockup.     Thank you, Toyota. After over a decade of trying, the S U P R A has surpassed its namesake. It's no wonder the words S U P R A and Legendary became synonymous with the JZA80.  Sadly, like so many Japanese greats, this wondrous car is no longer in production. But much like with the RX-7, there are whispers of the return of the S U P R A in the next few years. With a new GT-R coming from Nissan in 2007, will we see the S U P R A return in all its glory?  Let's hope so.

tibet:?-A region under the control of China since Kublia Khan claimed it under the Yuan Dynasty.  When the Ming dynasty defeated the Mongols, they inhereted the territory and communication continued throughout the Ming dynasty.  During the Qing Dynasty, China sent residential commissioners called amban to Lhasa and these amban are equal rank to the Dalai Lama.  After the fall of the Qing, china became a republic under the nationalist government and Britain, Tibet and China decide what to do with Tibet.  Britain recognized Tibet as under chinese Suzerainty just like Russia recogzized Mongolia.  Similiar to Mongolia, the British drew up an agreement where Tibet will be seperated into outer Tibet (modern day Tibet) ruled by the Dalai Lama and inner tibet (parts of present day sichuan and qinghai) where the religous aspect will be ruled by the Dalai Lama.  Unlike Mongolia with the russians, the nationalist party never signed the agreement.  Tibet as well as other provinces enjoyed de facto independence when the Chinese nation was torn by warlordism, Japanese invasion, and civil war (1911-1949).  However the nationalist still maintain sovereignty over Tibet.  Through the Succession of states theory in international law (Yuan, Ming, Qing, ROC, PRC)Tibet is still part of China and is now legally a province of China just like Xin Jiang and Inner mongolia.  Tibet is also known as Xizang to the chinese meaning western treasure.   
tiger:?-A big orange and black striped liony thing with sharp claws and rather a nasty bite. They don't usually eat men but that's only because they don't usually get the chance. Obviously, if you live near a tiger it may consider eating you. Basically, what I am saying is - the further away you live from a tiger, the less chance you have of getting eaten by one. I live in Selhurst in South London and NOBODY here has been eaten by a tiger since 1922 and I'm not even sure that it was a real tiger then (although I suppose if it ate someone it must have been a large carnivore so it may as well have been a tiger as anything else). Perhaps it was some sort of mock-tiger. Or maybe a stripey bear or something. I don't know, I wasn't even born then and you know what old people are like... The whole thing is probably a tissue of lies from start to finish. Anyway, thats sort of what a tiger is. So thats cleared that up then. Actually, I don't know why I bothered. I've never met a single person who didn't have some idea of what a tiger was so it seems a bit pointless describing one. I don't really think that the purpose of urban dictionary is to define the bleeding obvious. It really seems to be a forum for 'street' types to say things like "Yo!" and "Your mutherfucking sister's a ho!" and "Janice is such a slut" etc. Even such people as this probably know what a tiger is.

This is true but usually a witch is someone who includes spells with their wiccan studies (this is the majority of wiccans). People who do this are sometimes refered to as "Wiccan Witches".  Wiccans can be solitary practitioners (on their own) or be part of a coven. Covens don't normally accept wiccans under the age of 18. Some do persecute or lie about wiccans because of scary images of people dancing around fires naked, but wicca is actually a very peaceful and harmonious religion, although some practitioners do go "skyclad" (naked) if they feel comfortable. Usually going skyclad is just classed as getting in touch with nature.  Some wiccans do wear alot of black, not because they are goths, but because some believe that black helps them channel energy. A typical stereotype is that wiccans worship the devil. This is not true. In fact they believe in the goddess and the god. Another stereotype is that wiccans "hex" or "curse" people. There are some wiccans who decide to study "black magick" but very few actually practise it because it comes back to the crafter by the threefold law (basically the threefold law is the equilvent of "what goes around comes around" but in wicca it is "An Ye Harm None, Do What Thou Wilt."
